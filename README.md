- 👋 Hi, I’m @ramboss-sekai
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding software and hardware development to brace for an electrified future with advanced AI and automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and Python and have been sitting just outside the coding bootcamp pages for years now. Finally jumped in recently.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that can teach me more about practical programming for electrifying the global economy.
- 📫 How to reach me, send email to humans@roninev.com
